# Class 13 Reading notes

## Dive into HTML5
- storage is important because if webpage info is stored in native storage, it will reduce efficiency of application
- HTML5 storage 
  - stores everything as strings - must parse other types to ensure values are saved correctly
- Storage saves progress or data you used on a page : like playing a game that will restore level if you close window
- Standardized APIs:
  - SQL database: api for storing data in databases that can be queried in JS
- kind confused on what I just read

## things i want to learn
- What sort of things am I going to be storing in databases for my future projects
- Is saving data the same for each project i do?
