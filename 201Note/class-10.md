## “Error Handling & Debugging”
- execution contexts: 
  - Global context: code in script but not in function
  - Function context: code being run within a function
  - Eval context
- Stacking: JS reads top down, when script needs data from another function, stacking occurs: the new function piles on top of the preceding tasks
- Errors: throws exception then interpreter stops and looks for exception-handling code
  - Error handling code
  - no handling code, interpreter scans through code until reaching global context
  - creates error object and terminate the script
- Error objects: assists in pointnig out mistakes 
  - properties: names, message, fileNumber, and lineNumber
  Types: 
    - SyntaxError, syntax is incorrect
    - ReferenceError, variable that is not declared/out of scope
    - TypeError, value is unexpected data type
    - logic error? no syntax error but code runs incorrectly (infinite loops)
    - RangeError, number is outside of range
    - URLError, incorrect use of URI functions
    - EvalError, incorrect use of eval function
