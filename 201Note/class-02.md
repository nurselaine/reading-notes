## Chapter 2: “Text” 
<ul>
  <li>Create a webpage, add tags, </li>
  <li>Tags(markup) provide meaning and display on browsers for users </li>
  <li>Structural markup: elements to describe paragraphs & headings</li>
  <li>Semantic markup: provide more info <em> <i>, authors</li>
  <li>White space: provides readability when coding / white space collapsing on browser</li>
  <li>new tags</li>
  <ul>
      <li><hr /> hr line break between themes/topics, creates horizontal rule between sections</li>
      <li>blockquote: Used for long quotes with nested p tag | use q tag for shorter quotes</li>
      <li>abbr tag for abbreviations</li>
  </ul>

</ul>

## Chapter 10: Introducing "CSS"

  - Assocaite style rules with HTML: Selectors & declarations
  - Inline Styling **vs** External CSS
    - External: use link tag and include CSS file in href & include type and rel
      - Helps with readability and organization 
  - CSS Selectors 
    - Asterisks: universal selector
    - Type selectors: element names h1, p, etc
    - class selector: give elements class attribute
    - ID selectors: give elements id attribute and unique value
    - child selector: targets defined child element of parent
    - descendant selector: matches element nested in another 
    - adjacent sibling: matches the preceding sibling to element
    - general sibling: matches **any** sibling of element 
  - Selector Specificity: precedence in selectors is based off of which selector is more specific 
  - inheritance: applying styles to parent will affect children of parent 

## Chapter 2: “Basic JavaScript Instructions” (pp.53-84)
- **Statement** series of instructions followed by computer, each instruction is a statment
- Line Color
  - code is green
  - multiline comments are pink
  - single line comments are gray
- **Variables** store data types
- **Arrays** : use when working with list or related info - helpful when unknown amount of list items
- **Expression** evaluates into single value


## Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” only up to the section on switch statements (pp.145-162)
- Comparing operators
- Logical operators: provides results of more than one comparison
- && and || or ! not
- Using conditions
  - if statments
  - switch statments
- type coercion: JS converts data to be helpful

- Naming rules: letters, dollar sign, _ **No** numbers
- Arrays: stores data, allows easier access 
- Date Object: use constructor to create object
  - constructor: variable = new Date();
  - YYY, MM, DD, HH, MM, SS, MS format date
  - MMM DD, YYY, HH:MM:SS  

#### Things I want to learn:
<hr>
-
  -I would like to build a webpage and utilize the various text tags to improve the appearance and readability of the content
  - I hope to better understand selectors to utiltze them productively when coding
  - I want to learn how to write conditionals that appear simple and easy to read
