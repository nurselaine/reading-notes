## Class 01 Reading: Node Ecosystems

[Review if helpful: An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js)

1. How would you describe Node.js to a non-technical friend
  - Theres many languages you can use to code. Each language has their own type of place they can be used. For Javascript, Node.js is a place that it is used. Node runs JS code and allows for us to build tools that can be used by websites and many other things we use. 
2. What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript Runtime?
  - It's an environment which JS can be compiled(translated) to object code (computer language) which then in turn can be followed by the computer as a set of instructions (algorithm)
3. What is Node used for?
  - Node is used to run JS in chrome browsers
  - Node is most commonly used to run JS on the server
  - Node is used by JS developers to create server-side tools
    - it is used to pass async tasks to event loop 
    - Node is great for building real-time application (google docs because it uses real time editing and sharing)

#### Things that I want to know more
- What is the code that node compiler translates it to? What happens after the object code. Is it translated into an even lower level language?

- What is middleware
  - anything that touches req and res object is middleware
